Robert McCaull &amp; Betsy Hoekstra - Benchmarking the Memory Hierarchy

Only the files "README.md", "analysis.csv", "timeresults.csv", "timegraph.png", and "final_draft.cpp" are relevant to our submission.  The rest are
artifacts of our workflow.  

analysis.csv contains our analysis of the graph we produced.  

timeresults.csv contains the data we used to build our graph.  We built it using:
	./final 10 1 26 10

timegraph.png is the actual graph we produced.  

final_draft.cpp is the file containg our benchmarking code.  In the folder containing final_draft.cpp, we used:
	g++ final_draft.cpp -o final -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -O3
to compile it.
